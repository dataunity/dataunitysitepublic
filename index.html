		<h2>
			Welcome to Data Unity!
		</h2>
		<p>
			Data Unity is an open source web tool that lets people engage with structured data and share their discoveries with others. The tool promotes Open Data, where users can query and publish large amounts of data both from within their organisation and outside. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Data Unity lets users create visualisations of their data to help communicate insights. Sometimes it's difficult to recognise insights in the data because of the way it is presented. Good visualisations help make data more familiar, approachable and understandable. Infographics can tell stories in fewer words, so they lend themselves to being distributed beyond the system, like being posted on blog pages. Data Unity comes includes tools for creating and distributing insightful data visualisations.
