We ran an Open Data workshop in Bristol yesterday. It was a great day kindly hosted by the Pervasive Media Studio in Watershed with attendees from organisations like Environment Agency, Apache Foundation, ODI as well as local charities from England and Wales. Thanks to the people who attended for the stimulating discussions.

Ian Coles from Sustrans suggested we look at some of the Department for Transport figures on <a href="http://data.gov.uk" target="_blank">data.gov.uk</a>. We searched for data in CSV format which led us to one result - <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/gb-fatal-reported-road-accidents-06-08" target="_blank">Reported fatal personal injury road accident and casualty data: GB 2006-2008</a>. Unfortunately the data link seems to be down, but following the archive links we got to some data from 2011 <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http://www.dft.gov.uk/csv/601519/fatalaccidentdata.csv" target="_blank">here</a>. 

We choose the file labelled <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110204061441/http://www.dft.gov.uk/csv/601519/fatalaccidentdata.csv" target="_blank">Feb 04 2011</a>. Visualising the data in Data Unity gives us the following:
