We're excited to announce we're holding some Open Data workshops as part of the launch of Data Unity. We'll be running the workshops alongside another Nominet Trust funded project called WikiVOIS from SROI (www.wikivois.org). This is a great opportunity to get a demonstration of both Data Unity and WikiVOIS in action.

The locations for the workshops are Bristol, Liverpool and Birmingham. Dates are still being finalised, but will be between 25 Nov and 6 Dec 2013. The workshops will be interactive and we'll focus on data of interest to the attendees.

To register an interest, send an email to the address on our <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>. Please let us know which city you'd be interested in attending (Bristol, Liverpool or Birmingham).

You can keep up to date with the latest developments for Data Unity by signing up to the newsletter on our <a href="http://www.dataunity.org">home page</a>.
