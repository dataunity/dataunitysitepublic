We're holding some Open Data workshops as part of the launch of Data Unity. We'll be running the workshops alongside another Nominet Trust funded project called WikiVOIS from SROI (www.wikivois.org).

The locations for the workshops are Bristol, Liverpool and Birmingham. Dates are still being finalised, but will be between 25 Nov and 6 Dec 2013. The workshops will be interactive and we'll focus on data of interest to the attendees. This is a great opportunity to get a demonstration of both Data Unity and WikiVOIS.

To register an interest, please contact us on the email address on our contact page: www.dataunity.org/contact.html
