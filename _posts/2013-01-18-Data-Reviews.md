In software development we have code reviews where another developer will look over your code and mention areas which need improvement. If the code is released in an open way, like publishing to github, then number of people who can review the data is huge. It's a fantastic way to get the wisdom and experience of other experts.

We need more Data Reviews, where people push out their best interpretation of data and let people comment on it. Perhaps the real message in the data is being hidden by too much detail, or another visualisation on the data would help reveal the findings? Ask people to review your results. Ideally this is best combined with access to the source data set.
