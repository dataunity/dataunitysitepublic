Many thanks to the Environment Agency and Ordinance Survey (plus Geeks of London) for organising the env[:hack] event at Bristol Uni this weekend. Lots of apps generated in a short space of time, people seem really fired up by environment data.

Here's some links to the data that was used.

The Environment Agency has made some data publically available. There's a few different formats, but they are mainly GIS data:

They've listed some free and Open Source GIS software on the site: OpenJUMP GIS, ArcGIS Explorer Desktop and QGIS.
