I've spoken to some people who are reluctant to release any data. The reasons can boil down to their lack of confidence that they are expert enough to produce cast iron results (i.e. they don't think they can do data because they don't have a phd in Statistics). 

Sometimes it's best to treat releasing results as the start of a conversation, not the final word - be honest, put out what you have, note you level of confidence in your findings and get other people's input. Publishing data can be like learning - iterate, ask and improve.
