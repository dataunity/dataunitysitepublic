		<h3>Why is Data Unity needed?</h3>
		<p>
			People often lack the technical skills to engage with open data or their own organisation's data. Although there are tools like spreadsheets available, extracting meaningful insights can be challenging. This barrier is preventing people unlocking the value in data and releasing it to the organisation's stakeholders. It also means there's little motivation for organisations to release their data if people aren't engaging with it. Using Data Unity people will be able to get results from data which leads to a virtuous cycle where they seek out more data from organisations, increasing the impact of work. 
		</p>
		<h3>How does Data Unity work?</h3>
		<p>
			There is a simple front end tool for querying data called the Data Explorer. Users can create a query by dropping aspects of their data onto rows and columns and view the results as tables and graphics. Once these views on the data have been created they can be shared.
		</p>
		<p>
			Data Unity lets users create visualisations of their data to help communicate insights. Sometimes it's difficult to recognise insights in the data because of the way it is presented. Good visualisations help make data more familiar, approachable and understandable. Infographics can tell stories in fewer words, so they lend themselves to being distributed beyond the system, like being posted on blog pages. Data Unity comes includes tools for creating and distributing insightful data visualisations. 
		</p>
		<h3>How do I share my data and insights?</h3>
		<p>
			When insights have been gleaned using the Data Explorer tool they can be shared further afield using html snippets to paste the results into any website. More experienced web designers can use the javascript library or Web API to access and customise the results through code.
