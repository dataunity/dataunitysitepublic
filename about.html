		<h3>Why is Data Unity needed?</h3>
		<p>
			People often lack the technical skills to engage with open data or their own organisation's data. Although there are tools like spreadsheets available, extracting meaningful insights can be challenging. This barrier is preventing people unlocking the value in data and releasing it to the organisation's stakeholders. It also means there's little motivation for organisations to release their data if people aren't engaging with it. Using Data Unity people will be able to get results from data which leads to a virtuous cycle where they seek out more data from organisations, increasing the impact of work. 
		</p>
		<h3>How does Data Unity work?</h3>
		<p>
			There are several points of access to Data Unity, which is part of it’s core strength. First there is a simple front end tool for querying data called the Data Explorer. Users can create a query by dropping aspects of their data onto rows and columns and view the results as tables and graphics. 
		</p>
		<h3>How do I share my data and insights?</h3>
		<p>
			When insights have been gleaned using the Data Explorer they can be shared further afield using html snippets to paste the results into any website. More experienced web designers can use the javascript library or Web API to access and customise the results through code.
